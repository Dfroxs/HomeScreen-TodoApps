# 🏠 HomeScreen-TodoApps

HomeScreen-TodoApps is a simple yet elegant home screen UI for a to-do app built using **Jetpack Compose**. This project was created as a learning experience to explore and understand the capabilities of Jetpack Compose in building modern Android UI.

> 🎨 The UI design is inspired by a concept I found on **Figma**, which I tried to bring to life with Compose. [Link Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1143575071825582037/task-management-to-do-list-app)
